# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The project is in early development. Security fixes will be applied to the latest minor release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report security issues privately by opening a confidential advisory on GitHub (Security > Advisories) or by emailing the maintainer listed in `AUTHORS`.

Provide a minimal reproducer and impacted versions if possible. We will acknowledge your report within 72 hours and coordinate a fix and disclosure timeline.

## Scope

This project performs static analysis on untrusted inputs (ELF files). We welcome reports on crashes, panics, excessive resource consumption (CPU/RAM), and incorrect security conclusions that could mislead users.
